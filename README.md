# GenAI Chatbot Quickstart

This quickstart showcases how to use confluent cloud with flink to build a chatbot powereed by GenAI. Confluent Cloud enables
real-time data freshness and scalability for the chatbot. With Apache Kafka as its foundation, Confluent Cloud
orchestrates the flow of information between various components of the chatbot. Flink processes the data in real-time
and provides the chatbot with the necessary information to respond to user queries.
